/*Question 7
Assume that there is a function MID with the syntax,
MID(s1,m,n) where s1 a string, and m and n
are integers. Given that MID(s1,m,n) is to return n middle characters
of s1 starting from the character at position m,
write a computer solution that accepts as input a string of characters and
output the number of times a particular character appears in the input.*/
